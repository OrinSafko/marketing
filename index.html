        <h2 class="lh-copy mb5">Hi early bird! 👋</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy">We are the developers behind the widely popular open source personal CRM, <a href="https://github.com/monicahq/monica">Monica</a>.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">Companies have dozens of tools to manage what’s going on inside the company. Tools to manage human resources. Timesheets. Team morale. 1-on-1 management. Expenses. OKR. You name it. For every need, there is a dedicated tool.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">Companies spend an awful lot of time and money on choosing, setting up and maintaining all those tools.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">Put together, these tools are supposed to give answers to two questions: how is the company going, and how does an employee perform.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">However, how can you know if an employee performs well if you have only one angle of the overall sitaution? If you use a software that manages OKR, you would only have one side of the story at the end of the year. If you want to understand the complete picture, you need to know if the employee has taken enough holidays during the year, if the projects he worked on were a success, if he had enough time to talk with her manager, and so on.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">You could know all that by using the APIs of all the different softwares that answer part of those questions – but what a nightmare to set up everything.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">Moreover, most small and medium size companies don't need all the features that each one of these tools provide. They would be completely satisfied with, say, 20% of what each specialized tool does. Take a look at Basecamp. A lot of people love using Basecamp, a simple project management tool, instead of Microsoft Project which does 90% more stuff.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">We think there is a place for a single software that manages the entire lifecycle of an employee. By knowing everything we need to know about an employee, we can know how teams are doing, what everyone does, and gives you unique insights on how the company truly operates.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">A single tool that puts the employee at the core of the experience.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">A tool that advocates a complete transparency at every layer of the company.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy mb6">A tool that promotes communication and collaboration between every employee and every team.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy mb6 fw5">We’ve made this tool. It’s not ready yet, but it’ll be soon.</p>

        <p class="lh-copy">OfficeLife will let you manage the following aspect of your company in a very easy to use, privacy-first software:</p>
